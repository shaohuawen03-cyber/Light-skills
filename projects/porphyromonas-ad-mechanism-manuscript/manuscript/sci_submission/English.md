# Deep-learning screening, molecular docking and molecular dynamics of periodontitis oral micropeptides targeting human acetylcholinesterase

## Abstract

Periodontitis has been tied to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in clinical and experimental work, yet a peptide-level ligand that could act on a synaptic enzyme is still missing. Oral small open reading frames (smORFs) were scored with UniDL4BioPep, twelve 7–9-residue peptides were docked into human acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and 100-ns molecular dynamics (MD) was run on apo AChE and three complexes. The healthy-labelled library (11,269,961 sequences) and the periodontitis-labelled library (11,721,988 sequences) were both passed through 22 UniDL4BioPep classifiers at ≥0.80. Only the periodontitis branch was then matched to oral genomic and metaproteomic catalogues. Hits on the blood–brain-barrier peptide head numbered 1,095,861 (9.72%) in the healthy library and 1,125,832 (9.60%) in the periodontitis library. Intersection with 33,786 unique, catalogue-supported peptides left 3,518 sequences; NTxPred2, mebipred and AnOxPePred then reduced that list to twelve explicit peptides. All twelve are 7–9 residues, carry a net positive charge at pH 7.4, and are leucine-rich. Local AutoDock Vina (three runs) gave best poses between −8.25 and −9.60 kcal/mol. FLLHTTR, YLSLLQR and LLHPLRL contact the peripheral anionic site (PAS). Over 100 ns the FLLHTTR and YLSLLQR complexes stay more compact than apo AChE (backbone RMSD 0.1640 and 0.1625 nm versus 0.1897 nm). FLLHTTR keeps a dense hydrogen-bond net (7.03 ± 1.28); only YLSLLQR shrinks solvent-accessible surface area. These calculations outline a possible route in which oral micropeptides sit on the same PAS that accelerates amyloid-β (Aβ) assembly.

## Introduction

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) combines amyloid deposition, tau pathology, synaptic failure, immune activation and vascular injury over a long preclinical course [@scheltens2021alzheimer]. Sequential cleavage of APP by β- and γ-secretases releases Aβ40 and Aβ42; soluble oligomers injure synapses; familial APP/PSEN mutations change peptide length and amount [@selkoe2016amyloid]. Amyloid load does not explain the spatial or clinical heterogeneity of the disease, so peripheral inflammatory exposures have been examined as possible modifiers of vulnerability rather than as single sufficient causes.

Loss of basal-forebrain acetylcholine accounts for a large fraction of the cognitive picture, which is why AChE inhibitors remain in routine use [@hampel2018cholinergic]. Catalysis is only part of the enzyme’s role. AChE accelerates Aβ fibril growth through the peripheral anionic site (PAS), and AChE–Aβ particles are more toxic than free peptide [@inestrosa1996ache]. A short hydrophobic PAS motif is sufficient for that chaperone effect [@deferrari2001motif]. PAS-directed small molecules can block AChE-induced aggregation in biochemical assays [@bartolini2003pas]. The same protein surface therefore joins cholinergic failure to amyloid deposition.

Chronic periodontitis maintains a low-grade inflammatory load at a disrupted mucosal barrier and allows microbial products into blood [@chalmers2025primer]. Oral activity is species- and site-specific, so 16S abundance cannot stand in for a molecular ligand [@belstrom2021periodontitis]. Meta-analyses report associations between periodontal disease and cognitive disorders, although effect sizes move with case definitions [@larvin2023periodontalcognition]. In an AD cohort, periodontitis tracked later decline [@ide2016periodontitis]. A two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis did not support a genetic causal effect of periodontal disease on AD [@hu2024mendelian]. Epidemiology therefore motivates a molecular search; it does not identify the ligand.

Gingipains and outer-membrane vesicles of *Porphyromonas gingivalis* supply one mapped virulence pair [@guo2010gingipain; @ho2015omv]. The organism and gingipains have been reported in AD brains [@dominy2019pgingivalis], and repeated oral infection in mice produces neuroinflammation and Aβ-related changes [@ilievski2018oral]. Those observations justify looking at oral products. They do not, by themselves, name a peptide that occupies AChE.

Microbiome smORFs encode a large pool of uncharted small proteins [@sberro2019smallgenes; @durrant2021sorf]. Mining of human microbiomes for peptide antibiotics first scored millions of translated open reading frames and then applied experimental filters [@torres2024peptideantibiotics]. UniDL4BioPep supplies more than twenty binary bioactivity heads on ESM-2 embeddings [@du2023unidl4biopep]. That order—predict, then match to catalogues—is the order used here. Classifier scores do not answer the structural question of whether a 7–9-aa periodontitis peptide can occupy the Aβ-binding PAS.

Accelerated MD places Aβ on the AChE surface and treats the enzyme as a nucleation centre [@lushchekina2017amd]. A 1-μs PAS-centred AChE–Aβ trajectory remains bound, with the main residence at residues 344–361 [@atanasova2020md]. PDB 4EY6 gives a 2.40 Å human AChE frame for docking [@cheung2012ache]. The aromatic gorge that joins the catalytic triad to the PAS was mapped on *Torpedo* AChE [@kryger1999e2020]. What remains missing is a peptide-level ligand drawn from oral smORFs and tested on that same PAS.

Here we scored oral smORF libraries from PRJNA678453 with 22 UniDL4BioPep heads, compared healthy and periodontitis hit rates, matched the periodontitis branch to oral genomic and metaproteomic catalogues, and reduced the list with NTxPred2, mebipred and AnOxPePred. Twelve 7–9-aa peptides were docked into human AChE. Three complexes, together with apo enzyme, were simulated for 100 ns to test whether the peptides remain at the PAS without unfolding the fold.

## Materials and methods

### Study design

The work is computational. No new patients, specimens, sequencing runs or wet assays were added. Healthy and periodontitis tags are library labels; they are not peptide-level clinical diagnoses. Docking used local three-run AutoDock Vina poses. MD used 100-ns GROMACS trajectories of apo AChE and three peptide complexes.

### Source libraries

The public source is PRJNA678453, paired oral metagenomes and metatranscriptomes from periodontitis and orally healthy donors [@belstrom2021periodontitis]. Upstream processing of that BioProject produced translated smORF strings of 4–50 aa; a derived MGnify third-party assembly, PRJEB65451 (metaSPAdes v3.15.3), exists for the same project and is not a second clinical cohort. We did not reassemble reads or call genes de novo. The present work scored those strings with 22 UniDL4BioPep heads, matched the periodontitis branch to oral catalogues, and took twelve peptides into docking and MD. Library sizes were 11,269,961 healthy-labelled and 11,721,988 periodontitis-labelled sequences.

### UniDL4BioPep (22 tasks)

UniDL4BioPep was applied first to both full libraries, following the predict-then-filter order used when mining microbiome peptide antibiotics [@torres2024peptideantibiotics; @du2023unidl4biopep]. Du et al. freeze ESM-2 (`esm2_t6_8M_UR50D`; 6 layers, 8 million parameters, 320-dimensional residue states) and average residue embeddings so that peptides of any length collapse to one fixed vector. A convolutional classifier is then trained, per bioactivity, on that vector; the same backbone is reused across datasets rather than designing a new network for each endpoint. In the original report the architecture beat the previous state of the art on 15 of 20 binary peptide tasks. We did not retrain the networks. We scored 22 published heads: ACE inhibitory, DPP-IV inhibitory, Bitter, Umami, Antimicrobial, Antimalarial (alternative), Antimalarial (main), Quorum sensing, Anticancer (main), Anticancer (alternative), Anti-MRSA, TTCA, BBB (BBP), Anti-parasitic (APP), NeuroPred, Antibacterial, Antifungal, Antiviral, Toxicity, Antioxidant FRS, Allergenicity, and cell-penetrating peptide (CPP). Every head used a score cut of ≥0.80. “BBB-high” is that operational cut on the BBP head, not measured transcytosis. Other BBB peptide tools (for example Augur) are trained on different positives and encodings, so their published AUCs do not transfer to these 4–50-aa oral strings [@gu2024bbb].

### Catalogue matching (periodontitis branch only)

After scoring, only periodontitis-labelled sequences were exact-matched to oral genomic and metaproteomic resources and collapsed to unique peptides. HOMD and eHOMD supply curated aerodigestive genomes [@chen2010homd; @escapa2018ehomd]. Salivary metaproteomes record peptides inside their own false-discovery framework [@belstrom2016metaproteomics]. Further oral metaproteomic sets add sequence observations from other clinical contexts [@jiang2022oralmetaproteomics; @yuan2025osample]. A match supports prior observation of the string; it does not prove expression in PRJNA678453 samples. The periodontitis library yielded 33,786 unique catalogue-supported peptides. Intersection with the 1,125,832 periodontitis BBB (BBP) hits recovered 3,518 sequences (3,446 of 5–30 aa; 72 of 31–50 aa). The healthy library was left at the 22-task score tables and was not dereplicated.

### NTxPred2

NTxPred2 trains separate peptide and protein models because a single neurotoxin classifier does not transfer between length classes [@rathore2025ntxpred2]. The peptide set has 877 neurotoxic and 877 non-toxic sequences; the protein set has 775 of each. Composition and binary-profile machine-learning models reach AUC 0.97 (peptides) and 0.85 (proteins). Fine-tuning ESM2-t30 on the peptide set raises independent-set AUC to 0.98 (MCC 0.90). The public server uses ESM2-t30 for 7–50-aa inputs (default probability 0.5) and an extra-trees model for sequences ≥51 aa. We used the peptide (ESM2-t30) mode on 7–50-aa members of the 3,518-set. A positive call is a classifier label, not a neuronal assay.

### mebipred

mebipred predicts metal-binding from sequence alone, without alignments, so it can be applied to short translated fragments [@aptekmann2022mebipred]. Inputs are 219 sequence features: amino-acid composition, physicochemical descriptors, and counts of metal-binding 5-mers. A first feed-forward net (two hidden layers of 219 ReLU units, dropout 0.2, RMSprop) separates metal-binding from non-binding proteins; a second tier names 11 ions. The authors report >80% accuracy for ligand presence and an area under the precision–recall curve of 0.91. Default ion probability is 0.5; raising it to 0.9 increases precision at some cost in recall. We kept Cu-, Fe- and Zn-related scores at 0.50. The output is not a measured Kd and does not assign a coordination geometry.

### AnOxPePred

AnOxPePred is a one-dimensional CNN with two heads, trained to score free-radical scavenging (FRS) and metal chelation (CHEL) from one-hot peptide sequences [@olsen2020anoxpepred]. Positives were taken from BIOPEP-UWM and from antioxidant-peptide papers; each sequence is labelled FRS, chelator, or both. Reported FRS performance exceeds a k-NN baseline; the chelator head is weaker because that training subset is small. Both heads emit a score in [0, 1]. Serial cuts here were CHEL≥0.25, then CHEL≥0.25 with FRS<0.50, then CHEL≥0.25 with FRS<0.45. Concordance among UniDL4BioPep, NTxPred2, mebipred and AnOxPePred is a filter stack, not independent experimental replication.

### Physicochemical descriptors

For the twelve unique 7–9-aa strings we recalculated length, histidine, cysteine and Arg+Lys counts, average molecular weight, isoelectric point, net charge at pH 7.4, Kyte–Doolittle GRAVY, Ikai aliphatic index, hydrophobic residue fraction (A, I, L, M, F, V, W, Y), and Boman index. Scales were applied to the amino-acid strings only; no experimental HPLC or CD was performed.

### Molecular docking

Human recombinant AChE (PDB 4EY6, 2.40 Å) was stripped of galantamine and crystal waters, chain breaks were repaired, and protonation was set at pH 7.4 [@cheung2012ache]. The twelve ligands ALLLHRC, FCLHLQLR, FLLHTTR, HLLTLKKHV, HLPLLHRCC, HVLLLRQCA, LLHLPKRTT, LLHPLRC, LLHPLRL, WLLVHLKK, YHHLLCRR and YLSLLQR were docked with AutoDock Vina, exhaustiveness 32 [@trott2010vina; @eberhardt2021vina]. The grid was centred on the PAS (Tyr72, Asp74, Thr75, Leu76, Trp286, His287, Tyr341) and covered the gorge neck (Phe295), the choline subsite (Trp86, Glu202, Tyr337) and the catalytic triad (Ser203, His447, Glu334). Each ligand was run three times. We report best-run affinity, three-run mean ± SD, hydrogen-bond count and PAS contact from the single best pose. Vina scores rank poses; they are not experimental free energies.

### Molecular dynamics

Four explicit-solvent systems were built in GROMACS with Amber99SB-ILDN and TIP3P water at 0.15 M NaCl [@abraham2015gromacs; @lindorfflarsen2010amber]: apo AChE (chain A) and the ALLLHRC, FLLHTTR and YLSLLQR complexes. Each box was triclinic with a 1.0 nm solute-to-wall buffer. Equilibration was 2,000 steps of steepest descent, 1.0 ns restrained NVT to 300 K, 1.0 ns restrained NPT, and 1.0 ns free NPT. Production was 100 ns (dt = 2.0 fs) at 300 K and 1.0 bar with LINCS, 1.2 nm cut-offs and particle-mesh Ewald. Frames were stored every 20 ps.

Metrics matched Figures 5–7: Cα RMSD, per-residue RMSF, SASA, Rg, DSSP occupancy, and intermolecular hydrogen bonds (`gmx hbond`; donor–acceptor ≤ 3.0 Å). Peptide self-fit RMSD and persistent contacts (7.0 Å) were stored as extras. Means ± SD use the last 20 ns (80–100 ns). The design follows the AChE–Aβ MD logic of Atanasova et al., at 100 ns rather than 1 μs [@atanasova2020md].

## Results

### Twenty-two UniDL4BioPep tasks on both libraries

Figure 1 summarises the cascade. Both libraries were scored at ≥0.80 on all 22 heads (Tables 1 and 2). Hit rates sit close to each other. Antimicrobial called 10,302,093/11,721,988 periodontitis sequences (87.89%) and 9,882,657/11,269,961 healthy sequences (87.69%). BBB (BBP) called 1,125,832 (9.60%) versus 1,095,861 (9.72%). Anti-parasitic (APP) and quorum sensing were the next largest heads; DPP-IV inhibitory was the smallest in both libraries. Labels overlap, so one peptide can sit in several rows. Because the two BBB rates differ by only 0.12 percentage points, BBB-high is not a periodontitis-specific stamp. The two libraries are close on most of the 22 heads (Table 3). Periodontitis exceeds healthy by ≥1 percentage point only for quorum sensing (+1.39). Healthy exceeds periodontitis by ≥1 point for antifungal (−2.50), anti-parasitic (−2.36), antioxidant FRS (−1.95), antiviral (−1.89), antibacterial (−1.42), CPP (−1.24), anticancer-main (−1.22) and umami (−1.00). Antimicrobial is essentially tied (87.89% vs 87.69%). These are library-wide score rates, not sequence-level differential peptides: we do not have a row-wise overlap map, so we cannot say that the twelve docking sequences are absent from the healthy library. Downstream docking used the periodontitis, catalogue-matched branch only.

![Figure 1. Screening cascade from oral smORF libraries to twelve peptides and three MD complexes.](../figures/fig_screening_cascade.png)

**Figure 1. Screening cascade.** UniDL4BioPep (22 tasks) was applied to both libraries. Catalogue matching and later filters were applied only to the periodontitis branch, ending in twelve 7–9-aa peptides for docking and three complexes for 100-ns MD.

### Periodontitis funnel to twelve sequences

Catalogue matching of the periodontitis library kept 33,786 unique peptides. Intersection with BBB-high gave 3,518 sequences. NTxPred2 scored 3,299/3,518 (93.77%) and called 923/3,299 (27.98%) positive. Later cuts left 111 mebipred-positive peptides, 15 with CHEL≥0.25, 12 with CHEL≥0.25 and FRS<0.50, and 8 with the stricter FRS<0.45 (Table 4). All 923 NTxPred2-positive peptides were ≤30 aa, so the metal/CHEL/FRS steps kept short peptides only.

### Physicochemical profile of the twelve peptides

These descriptors characterise the twelve docking ligands. They are not a comparison of the healthy and periodontitis libraries.

The twelve strings are unique 7–9-aa peptides of standard residues (Table 5). Eleven contain histidine; six contain cysteine; every sequence has at least one Arg or Lys. Molecular weights fall between 825.03 and 1,097.30 Da. Isoelectric points are alkaline (8.28–11.54). Net charge at pH 7.4 is positive for all twelve (0.85–2.08). GRAVY is positive for ten sequences, in line with leucine-rich cores; LLHLPKRTT (−0.36) and YHHLLCRR (−0.95) are the two hydrophilic exceptions. Aliphatic indices run from 97.5 (YHHLLCRR) to 222.9 (LLHPLRL). YLSLLQR is the only peptide without histidine. These numbers describe composition; they are not HPLC or CD measurements.

### Docking to human AChE

All twelve ligands produced favourable Vina scores (Table 6, Figure 2). Best-run values ran from −8.25 to −9.60 kcal/mol; three-run means ran from −8.07 ± 0.16 to −9.44 ± 0.09 kcal/mol. Best-pose order was FLLHTTR (−9.60), YLSLLQR (−9.49), ALLLHRC (−9.29). Mean order put YLSLLQR first (−9.44 ± 0.09) and ALLLHRC second (−9.18 ± 0.11). FLLHTTR has the strongest single pose and the largest SD (−8.77 ± 1.41). Best poses made 3–10 hydrogen bonds (mean length 2.83–3.28 Å; Figures 3 and 4).

**Figure 4. Best docking poses, peptides 7–12 (G–L).** LLHPLRL (I) spans PAS Trp286/Tyr341 to catalytic His447. YLSLLQR (L) bridges PAS and the gorge mouth.

PAS contacts in the best pose were seen for FLLHTTR (Figure 3C), YLSLLQR (Figure 4L), FCLHLQLR, HVLLLRQCA, HLLTLKKHV and LLHPLRL (Figure 4I). ALLLHRC binds catalytic Ser203 with the shortest mean hydrogen bond (2.83 Å) rather than the outer PAS aromatics (Figure 3A). Three-run means separate ligands that stay strong across runs (YLSLLQR, ALLLHRC, LLHPLRL) from ligands whose best pose is better than the run average (FLLHTTR, FCLHLQLR, YHHLLCRR).

### 100-ns dynamics of apo AChE and three complexes

Production runs finished for apo AChE and the ALLLHRC, FLLHTTR and YLSLLQR complexes (Table 7, Figures 5–7). Each six-panel figure compares apo with one complex: RMSD (A), RMSF (B), SASA (C), Rg (D), last-20-ns DSSP (E) and intermolecular hydrogen bonds (F).

| Metric | apo AChE | ALLLHRC | FLLHTTR | YLSLLQR |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cα RMSD (nm) | 0.1897 ± 0.0090 | 0.1916 ± 0.0092 | 0.1640 ± 0.0080 | 0.1625 ± 0.0078 |
| Peptide self-fit RMSD (nm) | — | 0.2518 ± 0.0136 | 0.1752 ± 0.0111 | 0.0911 ± 0.0098 |
| RMSF mean (nm) | 0.0835 ± 0.0659 | 0.0876 ± 0.0581 | 0.0778 ± 0.0504 | 0.0771 ± 0.0498 |
| SASA (nm²) | 212.25 ± 2.89 | 217.47 ± 2.49 | 213.88 ± 2.36 | 209.71 ± 2.35 |

| Intermolecular H-bonds | — | 2.19 ± 0.80 | 7.03 ± 1.28 | 2.93 ± 1.14 |

Apo RMSD levels near 0.19 nm (Figures 5A–7A). ALLLHRC follows that control (complex 0.1916 nm). FLLHTTR and YLSLLQR drop below apo after 50–70 ns (0.1640 and 0.1625 nm), which reads as rigidification, not unfolding. Peptide self-fit RMSD is highest for ALLLHRC (0.2518 nm) and lowest for YLSLLQR (0.0911 nm). Catalytic-core RMSF stays low; mean RMSF is below apo for FLLHTTR and YLSLLQR. Rg remains 2.30–2.31 nm. SASA rises for ALLLHRC (217.47 nm²), sits near apo for FLLHTTR (213.88 nm²), and falls only for YLSLLQR (209.71 nm²; Figure 7C). Hydrogen-bond histories differ: ALLLHRC decays to 2.19 ± 0.80; FLLHTTR holds 7.03 ± 1.28 for the whole run (Figure 6F); YLSLLQR averages 2.93 ± 1.14. Helix (~33%) and sheet (~17%) overlay the apo bars. Each complex keeps seven persistent contact pairs. Centre-of-mass RDF peaks lie at 1.22 nm (ALLLHRC), 1.80 nm (FLLHTTR) and 1.62 nm (YLSLLQR), i.e. surface residence rather than bulk solvent.

## Discussion

AChE is not only a hydrolase of acetylcholine. Inestrosa et al. showed that the enzyme accelerates Aβ fibril assembly through the PAS and that AChE–Aβ particles are more toxic than free peptide [@inestrosa1996ache]. A short hydrophobic PAS motif is sufficient for that chaperone effect [@deferrari2001motif], and PAS-directed ligands can suppress AChE-induced aggregation in biochemical assays [@bartolini2003pas]. Those experiments identify the PAS as a structural hinge between cholinergic failure and amyloid deposition [@selkoe2016amyloid; @hampel2018cholinergic]. The present docking and 100-ns trajectories ask whether periodontitis-derived micropeptides can occupy that same site.

Deep-learning peptide mining supplies a practical route into that question. Torres et al. scored millions of translated microbiome open reading frames before applying experimental filters [@torres2024peptideantibiotics]. UniDL4BioPep uses the same predict-then-filter logic on ESM-2 embeddings, with a convolutional head reused across bioactivity tasks [@du2023unidl4biopep]. NTxPred2, mebipred and AnOxPePred were trained for neurotoxic, metal-binding and antioxidant endpoints rather than for AChE occupancy [@rathore2025ntxpred2; @aptekmann2022mebipred; @olsen2020anoxpepred]. Serial scores are therefore a triage stack, as in those original reports, not independent wet-lab replication. Catalogue matches to HOMD, eHOMD and salivary metaproteomes support prior observation of a string [@chen2010homd; @escapa2018ehomd; @belstrom2016metaproteomics], which is the same role those resources play in other oral peptide studies [@jiang2022oralmetaproteomics; @yuan2025osample; @sberro2019smallgenes].

Human AChE (PDB 4EY6) provides an experimentally determined frame for the gorge and PAS [@cheung2012ache], following the aromatic-gorge map obtained on *Torpedo* AChE [@kryger1999e2020]. AutoDock Vina is widely used as a first-pass ranking engine [@trott2010vina; @eberhardt2021vina]. In that setting, best poses of FLLHTTR, YLSLLQR and LLHPLRL contact the PAS residues that Inestrosa and De Ferrari implicated in Aβ assembly, and HLLTLKKHV reaches Phe346 in the 344–361 zone where Atanasova et al. kept Aβ for 1 μs [@atanasova2020md]. Those contacts are consistent with the earlier PAS pharmacology rather than a new binding site invented by the screen.

MD studies of AChE–Aβ already treat the enzyme as a nucleation centre. Accelerated sampling pulled Aβ onto the AChE surface [@lushchekina2017amd], and a 1-μs PAS-centred trajectory remained bound without unfolding the fold [@atanasova2020md]. The same occupancy pattern appears here on a 100-ns window: FLLHTTR and YLSLLQR complexes stay more compact than apo AChE, hydrogen bonds persist, and centre-of-mass distances remain in the surface-residence range. Lower complex RMSD than apo has been read in other ligand–protein MD work as increased local rigidity after binding; that reading matches Lushchekina’s surface-bound, non-dissociating complex rather than peptide-driven unfolding.

An oral exposure path is supported by specific prior cases, not by the present score tables. *P. gingivalis* and gingipains have been reported in AD brains [@dominy2019pgingivalis]. Repeated oral infection in wild-type mice produced neuroinflammation and Aβ-related changes [@ilievski2018oral]. Gingipains and outer-membrane vesicles provide vehicles for bacterial cargo beyond the producing cell [@guo2010gingipain; @ho2015omv]. Meta-analyses and an AD cohort link periodontitis to later cognitive decline [@larvin2023periodontalcognition; @ide2016periodontitis], whereas a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis did not support a genetic causal effect [@hu2024mendelian]. Those reports justify looking at oral products at the PAS; they do not assign the twelve peptides to *P. gingivalis* or prove blood–brain transport [@chalmers2025primer; @gu2024bbb; @belstrom2021periodontitis].

Taken together, the literature examples above support a bounded structural hypothesis: short, cationic, leucine-rich oral micropeptides can occupy the experimentally mapped Aβ-binding PAS and remain there on a 100-ns timescale. They do not replace a binding assay or an Aβ-aggregation experiment.

## Conclusions

Twelve 7–9-aa peptides from a periodontitis-labelled oral smORF library dock to human AChE. FLLHTTR, YLSLLQR and ALLLHRC remain on the surface for 100 ns without unfolding the enzyme. FLLHTTR forms the densest PAS hydrogen-bond net; YLSLLQR is the only complex that buries solvent-accessible surface. The calculations support a possible mechanism in which oral pathogenic peptides occupy AChE, hinder acetylcholine access, and co-nucleate Aβ on the same PAS.
